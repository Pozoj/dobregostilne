  The book "From a good Inn, to a nice place to spend the night in Slovenia", by the authors Drago Medved and Peter Rebernik was made with frequent travellers in mind. These people normally don't plan where they'll make a break and have something to eat. Consider this example: a delivery service driver is approaching Maribor and he starts to feel a bit hungry or tired or both. Sure he can stop in the first place that comes by, but he can also think like this: "I would really like some good sausages and a cold beer in the shadow right now... Is there a place that offers that somewhere near?" That's just the time this book or site kicks in. Using the fast search, you can quickly and conveniently locate the place that suits your needs. Finding it also won't be a problem due to the excellent mapping service.
